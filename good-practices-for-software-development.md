### Review Questions 

**Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?**  
**Answer:** The points I didn't know are :  
- GitHub gists for sharing code snippets.
- About sandbox environments for sharing entire setup.

**Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**  
**Answer:** The areas are :  
- **Engage sociallly and collaboration** : Stay connected with the co-workers by constant communication with them and check the messages of colleagues frequently for constant communication.
- **Deep work techniques and minimize distractions** : Working in focused and diffused modes of learning so that I can work efficiently without much problem. To minimize distractions I would keep mobile phone on DND mode and allow notification for only work-related apps.
- **Time management and Effective questioning** : I will keep track of my tasks and deadlines through tools like Trello. I will improve my questioning ability so that the other person can easily resolve my doubts and questions.

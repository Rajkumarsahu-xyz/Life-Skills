**Question 2:** How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?  
**Answer:** B = MAP means that your actions depend on how much you want to do something, how easy it is, and if you have a reminder. To form a habit, begin with simple tasks you don't need much motivation for. Then, as it becomes a habit, try more challenging tasks.

**Question 3:** Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)  
**Answer:** Feeling happy when you do something well is called 'shine.' When we cheer for and feel happy about small accomplishments, we get used to them quicker. Celebrating even small successes makes us more motivated and confident. It's not about how big the success is, but how often we succeed that matters.
